## Overview
This project is a manual testing project in which i have created lots of test cases of amazon website  in the **TestRail** which is a **test management tool**. The goal of this project  is to get familiar with writting test cases and learning the test management tools and its functionality in the real world.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning manual testing in TestRail, ensure you have the following:

**TestRail Account:** You must have an active TestRail account. Contact your administrator for access.
**Test Plan/Project:** A test plan or project has been created and is ready for test execution.
**Test Cases:** Test cases should be created in TestRail or imported into the test plan.
**Test Environment:** Ensure the application or environment to be tested is set up and ready.

**Logging into TestRail**
Open the TestRail URL in your browser.
Enter your **username** and **password**.
Click **Log in** to access your TestRail dashboard.

**Test Plan Setup**
To begin manual testing, follow these steps:

**Create or Access a Test Plan:**

Navigate to **Test Plans** from the main dashboard.
Click on **Add Test Plan** to create a new test plan or select an existing one.
Name the test plan and add relevant test suites to it.

**Add Test Cases:**

Ensure the test cases you want to execute are part of the test plan.
If needed, you can create new test cases under the **Test Cases** section.

**Creating/Managing Test Cases**
1.**Create a New Test Case:**

Go to **Test Cases** and click on **Add Test Case**.
Provide the following details for each test case:
**Title:** A brief description of the test.
**Preconditions:** Any setup required before running the test.
**Steps:** Clear, actionable steps to follow.
**Expected Result:** What should happen if the test is successful.
**Attachments:** Add any necessary files or images.

2.**Edit or Organize Test Cases:**

If needed, edit test cases to reflect changes in the system or app.
Organize test cases into **Test Suites** for easy navigation and execution (e.g., "**Regression**", "**Smoke Testing**").

**Test Execution Process**
Create a Test Run:

From the Test Runs section, click Add Test Run.
Select the test plan, suite, and test cases you want to execute.
**Execute Test Cases:**

Open the Test Run and begin executing the test cases.
For each test case:
Follow the steps outlined in the test case.
Update the status of the test case:
**Passed:** The test case worked as expected.
**Failed:** The test case did not meet expectations.
**Blocked:** The test case could not be executed due to external dependencies.
**Untested:** The test has not yet been executed.
Add **comments** or **attachments** if needed (e.g., screenshots, logs).

3.**Mark Test as Completed:**

Once all test cases are executed, mark the test run as completed.
Ensure that all statuses are updated for accurate tracking.

**Logging Test Results**

1.**Update Test Results:**
After executing each test, update the result in TestRail with the following:
**Result Status:** Select whether the test passed, failed, or was blocked.
**Comment:** Provide additional details such as errors encountered, specific issues, or why a test was blocked.
**Attachments:** Upload relevant screenshots or logs to clarify the results.

2.**Review Test Execution:**
Regularly check the test run to ensure that results are updated and accurate.

**Generating Reports**
1.**Generate Test Run Reports:**
Once the test run is complete, you can generate reports for a comprehensive overview.
Navigate to the Reports section in TestRail and select the desired report format (e.g., PDF, Excel).
2.**Export Results:**
You can export test results to formats like Excel or CSV for detailed analysis or to share with stakeholders.

**Best Practices**
Be Detailed in Test Cases: Ensure test cases are clear and cover all necessary steps and expected outcomes.
**Update Test Results Promptly:** Log test results as soon as they are completed to avoid missing any critical details.
**Use Descriptive Comments:** Provide detailed information when a test fails or is blocked. This will help the development team address the issues effectively.
**Organize Test Cases Logically:** Group similar tests into test suites and use proper naming conventions to make test case execution easier.

**Troubleshooting**
1.**Test Case Not Executing Properly:**

*Check the test environment for issues that may prevent the test from running correctly.
*Verify that all preconditions are met and dependencies are satisfied. 
2.**Login Issues:**

*Double-check your credentials.
*If you can't log in, reset your password or contact the administrator.

3.**Test Case Status Not Updating:**

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to modify test results.
If the issue persists, try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache.
# Conclusion
This README is a demonstration for  managing and executing manual tests using **TestRail**. By following this process,we can ensure that your test cases are organized, executed efficiently, and results are accurately logged for further analysis.
